# bbbadm
Moodle local plugin

# Attention!

This plugin does not work without a modified mod_bigbluebuttonbn module ( https://github.com/vel21ripn/moodle-mod_bigbluebuttonbn )!

The plugin is designed to configure the restriction of connections to BBB-servers.

Also, the plugin allows you to view the current status of BBB-servers.

Work in progress!
